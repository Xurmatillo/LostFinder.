Find your lost item quickly and easily using your smartphone camera.

The project is a mobile application for iOS that uses Vision AI to help users locate lost items by utilizing their phone's camera. The app interface is designed to be user-friendly and similar to Google's Lookout app. Users can enter a description or photo of their lost item and the app will activate the phone's camera to scan the surrounding area. The camera view is displayed on the screen, and the app uses computer vision algorithms to detect the lost item in real-time. Once the lost item is detected, the app will alert the user and guide them towards the location of the item. The app is intended to be a helpful tool for anyone who frequently loses items, such as keys, wallets, or phones, and wants a quick and easy way to locate them. The app's features can be further enhanced with additional sensors and integration with smart home devices, allowing for more seamless and accurate item detection. Overall, this project aims to improve the daily lives of users by providing a simple and effective solution to a common problem.
